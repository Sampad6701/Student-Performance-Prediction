# Student-Performance-Prediction

> **Status:** Academic Prototype (Semester Project)  
> **Model Used:** Decision Tree Classifier 
> **Future Direction:** Extended Academic Experimentation

---

## Overview

This repository contains a lightweight **Student Performance Prediction** system developed as part of a university semester project.

The primary goal of Version **V1.0** was to understand how a simple Machine Learning pipeline — from data preprocessing to training and evaluation — can be built efficiently using a **Decision Tree model**.

While the current implementation is intentionally minimal, this project is being extended into a broader experimental framework for educational analytics in future versions.

## Problem Statement

The project attempts to answer:

> *Educational institutions aim to identify students at risk of poor academic performance.  
Decision Tree models provide interpretable rules that help understand the factors influencing student outcomes.*

This version of project focuses on building a simple and transparent supervised learning pipeline for academic demonstration.

## Current Limitations (V1)

This is a classroom-scale prototype and therefore:

- Uses a small dataset  
- Relies on a single baseline model  
- Limited hyperparameter tuning  
- No deployment pipeline  
- Intended for academic demonstration  

---

## Vision for V2+

Upcoming versions may explore:

- Comparing multiple algorithms (Random Forest, XGBoost, SVM)  
- Feature engineering experiments  
- Larger datasets  
- Hyperparamter tuning
- Explainability tools
- Simple deployment interface
